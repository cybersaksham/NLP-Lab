we have learned the differences between the various parts of speech tags such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Associating each word in a sentence with a proper POS (part of speech) is known as POS tagging or POS annotation. POS tags are also known as word classes, morphological classes, or lexical tags.

Back in the days, the POS annotation was manually done by human annotators but being such a laborious task, today we have automatic tools that are capable of tagging each word with an appropriate POS tag within a context.
